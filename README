GDAV is a simple set of tools for publishing EST, gene or protein
annotations on your lab or institution's web server. You may process,
annotate and align your sequences in any way you like. GDAV just
requires that you provide three simple file formats, each using the
same sequence identifiers:

 o  One FASTA file of sequences
 o  Tab-delimited file(s) of sequence annotations
 o  GFF3 file(s) of genome alignments

full details and installation instructions are available at http://www.vectorbase.org/Help/GDAV
